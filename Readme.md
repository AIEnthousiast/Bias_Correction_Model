# Bias-correction-model--MBI
Bias Correction of Regional Climate Models

The dataset includes modeled (mod) and observed (obs) climate data.

Goal: Develop a correction function to reconstruct observed values as accurately as possible from the modeled values. 

Target variables are:

- Temperature
- Precipitation


Inputs and Outputs:

Input: Modeled data (mod)
Target: Observed data (obs)

Tasks:

Analyze the Data: Investigate the differences between model predictions and observations, including graphical representations of the discrepancies.

Benchmark Model: Create a multivariate linear regression model for both temperature and precipitation.

Neural Network: Utilize a neural network for the correction task.

Ensemble: do ensembles improve the result?

Performance Comparison: Compare the various approaches using suitable performance metrics.
